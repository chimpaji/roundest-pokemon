This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## TODO

- [ ] Persist data fetched from PokemonAPI
- [ ] Create the results page with counting/sorting
- [ ] Use next/image to handle image caching and better rendering
- [ ] Maybe move images to bulbapedia
